<p>A Note from the Team We do ask that you treat our service and community with respect. Spam, personal attacks, and abusive language do not have a place on the PatchChat. If you ever stumble across anything on the PatchChat that looks like it violates our policies, please be sure to <a href="{{ route("contact") }}"> let us know</a>.</p>

<h2>Accepting the Terms of Service</h2>

<p>The PatchChat Service (the “Service”) is a set of related Internet sites and other applications for questions and answers, owned and operated by PatchChat Inc. (“PatchChat”), a Canadian corporation. Please read these terms of service (“Agreement”) carefully before using the Service or any services provided on the Service (collectively, “Services”). By using or accessing the Services, you agree to become bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, do not use the Services. The Services are accessed by You (“Subscriber” or “You”) under the following terms and conditions:</p>

<h3>1. Access to the Services</h3>

<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, PatchChat may offer to provide the Services, as described more fully on the Service, and which are selected by Subscriber, solely for Subscribers own use, and not for the use or benefit of any third party. Services shall include, but not be limited to, any services PatchChat performs for Subscriber, as well as the offering of any Content (as defined below) on the Service. PatchChat may change, suspend or discontinue the Services at any time, including the availability of any feature, database, or Content PatchChat may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict Subscribers access to parts or all of the Services without notice or liability. PatchChat reserves the right, at its discretion, to modify these Terms of Service at any time by posting revised Terms of Service on the Service and by providing notice via e-mail, where possible, or on the Service. Subscriber shall be responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such modifications. Use of the Services by Subscriber following such modification constitutes Subscriber's acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement as modified.</p>

<p>No one under the age of 16 may provide any personal information to or on PatchChat (including, for example, a name, address, telephone number or email address). Subscriber also certifies that they are legally permitted to use the Services and access the Service, and takes full responsibility for the selection and use of the Services and access of the Service. This Agreement is void where prohibited by law, and the right to access the Service is revoked in such jurisdictions. PatchChat makes no claim that the Service may be lawfully viewed or that Content may be downloaded outside of Canada. Access to the Content may not be legal by certain persons or in certain countries. If you access the Service from outside Canada, You do so at Your own risk and You are responsible for compliance with the laws of Your jurisdiction.</p>  

<p>PatchChat will use reasonable efforts to ensure that the Service and Services are available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. However, there will be occasions when the Service and/or Services will be interrupted for maintenance, upgrades and repairs or due to failure of telecommunications links and equipment. Every reasonable step will be taken by PatchChat to minimize such disruption where it is within PatchChats reasonable control.</p>  

<p>You agree that neither PatchChat nor the Service will be liable in any event to You or any other party for any suspension, modification, discontinuance or lack of availability of the Service, the service, any Subscriber Content, or other Content. PatchChat retains the right to create limits on use and storage in its sole discretion at any time with or without notice.</p>  

<p>Subscriber shall be responsible for obtaining and maintaining any equipment or ancillary services needed to connect to, access the Service or otherwise use the Services, including, without limitation, modems, hardware, software, and long distance or local telephone service. Subscriber shall be responsible for ensuring that such equipment or ancillary services are compatible with the Services.</p>

</ol>

<h3>4. Restrictions</h3>

Subscriber acknowledges that PatchChat has no control over, and no duty to take any action regarding: which users gains access to the Service ; which Content Subscriber accesses via the Service; what effects the Content may have on Subscriber; how Subscriber may interpret or use the Content; or what actions Subscriber may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content. Much of the Content of the Service is provided by and is the responsibility of the user or subscriber who posted the Content. PatchChat does not monitor the Content of the Service and takes no responsibility for such Content. Subscriber releases PatchChat from all liability for Subscriber having acquired or not acquired Content through the Service. The Service may contain, or direct Subscriber to sites containing, information that some people may find offensive or inappropriate. PatchChat makes no representations concerning any content contained in or accessed through the Service, and PatchChat will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality or decency of material contained in or accessed through the Service.</p>
<p>Although PatchChat and the Service will make reasonable efforts to store and preserve the material residing on the Service, neither PatchChat nor the Service is responsible or liable in any way for the failure to store, preserve or access Subscriber Content or other materials you transmit or archive on the Service. You are strongly urged to take measures to preserve copies of any data, material, content or information you post or upload on the Service.</p>
<p>The Services, Content, Service and any Software are provided on an "as is" basis, without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including, without limitation, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement.

<p>Some states do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so the above limitations may not apply to Subscriber.</p>

<h3>6. Third party websites</h3>

<p>Users of the Service may gain access from the Service to third party sites on the Internet through hypertext or other computer links on the Service. Third party sites are not within the supervision or control of PatchChat or the Service.

<h3>7. Registration and security</h3>

<p>As a condition to using Services, Subscriber may be required to register with PatchChat and select a password and profile name. Subscriber shall provide PatchChat with accurate, complete, and updated registration information, including Subscribers e-mail address. Failure to do so shall constitute a breach of this Agreement, which may result in immediate termination of Subscriber's account. Subscriber may not (a) select or use as a profile name a name of another person with the intent to impersonate that person; or (b) use as a profile name a name subject to any rights of a person other than Subscriber without appropriate authorization. PatchChat reserves the right to refuse registration of, or cancel a profile name in its discretion. Subscriber shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of Subscriber's password. Subscriber is solely responsible for any use of or action taken under Subscribers password and accepts full responsibility for all activity conducted through Subscribers account and agrees to and hereby releases the Service and PatchChat from any and all liability concerning such activity. Subscriber agrees to notify PatchChat immediately of any actual or suspected loss, theft, or unauthorized use of Subscribers account or password. The Service will take reasonable security precautions when using the Internet, telephone or other means to transport data or other communications, but expressly disclaims any and all liability for the accessing of any such data communications by unauthorized persons or entities.</p>

<h3>8. Indemnity</h3>

<p>Subscriber will indemnify and hold PatchChat, its directors, officers, employees, agents, consultants, contractors, partners, vendors and service providers (including, without limitation, hosting and telecommunications providers) harmless, including costs and attorneys' fees, from any claim or demand made by any third party due to or arising out of Subscribers access to the Service, use of the Services, the violation of this Agreement by Subscriber, or the infringement by Subscriber, or any third party using the Subscriber's account, of any intellectual property or other right of any person or entity.</p>

<h3>9. Limitation of liability</h3>

<p>In no event shall PatchChat, its directors, officers, shareholders, employees, members, agents, consultants, contractors, partners, vendors and service providers (including, without limitation, hosting and telecommunications providers) be liable with respect to the Service or the Services for (a) any indirect, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages of any kind whatsoever; (b) damages for loss of use, profits, data, images, Subscriber Content or other intangibles; (c) damages for unauthorized use, non-performance of the Service, errors or omissions; or (d) damages related to downloading or posting Content. PatchChats and the Service's collective liability under this agreement shall be limited to two hundred and fifty Canadian Dollars. Some provinces do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations and exclusions may not apply to Subscriber.</p>

<h3>10. Fees and payment</h3>

<p>Some of the Services require payment of fees. Subscriber shall pay all applicable fees, as described on the Service in connection with such Services selected by Subscriber, and any related taxes or additional charges. All fees are non-refundable unless expressly stated otherwise on the Service. Subscriber represents to PatchChat that Subscriber is the authorized account holder or an authorized user of the chosen method of payment used to pay for the paid aspects of the Services. All fee-based Services and virtual goods are provided AS IS with no warranties of any kind. PatchChat may modify and/or eliminate such fee-based Services at its discretion. Subscriber understands and agrees that the payment for virtual goods grants Subscriber a limited license to use the virtual goods as specified on the Service.</p>
<p>PatchChat may change its prices at any time but will provide you reasonable notice of any such changes by posting the new prices on the Service and by sending you email notification. If you do not wish to pay the new prices, you may cancel the services prior to the change going into effect.</p>

<h3>11. Termination</h3>

<p>Either party may terminate the Services at any time by notifying the other party by any means. PatchChat may also terminate or suspend any and all Services and access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, if Subscriber breaches any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement. Upon termination of Subscriber's account, Subscribers right to use the Services, access the Service, and any Content will immediately cease. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability. Termination of Your access to and use of the Service and the Services shall not relieve Subscriber of any obligations arising or accruing prior to such termination or limit any liability which Subscriber otherwise may have to PatchChat or the Service, including without limitation any indemnification obligations contained herein.</p>

This Agreement replaces all prior or contemporaneous understandings or agreements, written or oral, regarding the subject matter hereof.

<p>PatchChat shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond PatchChats reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.
