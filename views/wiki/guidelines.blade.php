	possible.</li>
	<li>Post in a way consistent with

	grammar or incorrect spelling.</li>
	<li>Do not use bad
	English.</li>
	<li>Do not use
	contractions (I&rsquo;ve, can&rsquo;t, hasn&rsquo;t). Instead, use
	the long forms of the words.</li>

</OL>

<p><B>Spelling Used On a Wiki Page </B>
</P>

<p>The  spelling  used
in the Simple English Wikipedia can be the spelling of any valid
version of English. Two common versions are <A HREF="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English">British
English</A> and <A HREF="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English">American
English</A>.</p>
<p>Different spellings
should not be mixed in an article. It will look bad if one spelling
is mixed with another. It is best to write in the spelling you are
used to. If you write in a spelling you aren't used to, you might not
know that the grammar is also different sometimes.</p>
<p>For members on .CA
website use British English, for our members on our .US website use
American English.</p>
<h3>Citing Your
Sources</h3>
<p>It is important to
cite your sources that you might have used in authoring a PatchChat
Wiki. In the event that you did use a source besides your own
expertise and knowledge please read the following first.</p>
<OL>
	<li>Do not use
	sources, which copied their information from Wikipedia
	(<A HREF="http://www.wikipedia.org">www.wikipedia.org</A>) also, do
	not use Wikipedia itself (in any language) as a source.</li>
	<li>Do not use
	sources such as newspapers.</li>
	<li>Do not use
	Quora (<A HREF="http://www.quora.com">www.quora.com</A>) as a
	source.
	</li>
	<li>You should
	always add a reference when quoting published material. You should
	always include the page number if there is one. The reference should
	be placed either right after the quotation</li>
</OL>

<p>              <I>Example:</I>  &quot;This
is a quotation&quot;.<SUP>[1]</SUP></P>
<h3>Image Upload Policy</h3>

<OL>
	<li>The suggested
	size for a picture is 1024x768.
	</li>
	<li>Do not say who
	took the photo in an article. That information should be on the
	image description page only. 
	</li>
	<li>Use a good
	caption &ndash; a full sentence that describes the image is
	appropriate.</li>
	<li>All of the
	images on the &quot;PatchChat Wiki&quot; web site are free of
	copyright and can be used anywhere in the world. This supports
	PatchChat's goal of being an easy-to-read, easy-to-translate and
	free resource industry Wiki.</li>
